# Full(MERN) Stack e-Commerce App
## Description
This is a full MERN Stack e-commernce app built in react.JS, node.Js. A user can register and find all the products he/she interests in. Many categories used to 
store the product of individual categoriy. You can select any size of product and any color you want and which are available in the stock. For the authentication, I have used JWT(JSON Web Token). After selecting any product, add it to the cart and can pay bill via stripe.
## Frontend Technologies
I have used one of the most popular framework React.JS as a frontend. For the state management I have used redux.
## Backend Technologies
I have used Node.JS as a backend. Instead if Node.JS, I prefered Express.JS which is the node.JS framework to handle API's easily as compared to pure Node.JS. JWT(Json Web Token)
is used for authentication.

## Database
MongoDB is used as a database for this application.

## Payment Gateway
Stripe is used as a gateway of online payment. Anyone can pay their bill through stripe gateway with master card / visa card.
